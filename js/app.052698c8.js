We learned in the previous section that foundation models have ushered in an era where scale—model size, data volume, and computational resources—has become a cornerstone of AI capabilities. This section aims to delve further into model scaling and its pivotal role in AI capabilities.\n\n## The Bitter Lesson\n\n<iframe style=" width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" frameborder="0"  allowfullscreen src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEgq6sT1uq8">\n</iframe>\n\n**What is the bitter lesson?** Traditionally, AI research has predominantly designed systems under the assumption that a fixed amount of computing power will be available to the designed agent. However, over time, computing power so far has been expanding in line with Moore\'s law (the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every 1.5 years) ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore\'s_law)). So researchers could either leverage their human knowledge of the domain or exploit increases in general-purpose computational methods. Theoretically, the two were mutually compatible, but as time went on it was discovered that “*the biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. … [The bitter lesson teaches us] the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.*” - Sutton, Rich (March 2019) “[The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)”\n\n**Why is it bitter?** The \'bitter\' part of the lesson refers to a hard-learned truth: human ingenuity is not as important as we thought it was. The lesson outlines how general methods leveraging computation are ultimately more effective in achieving AI performance, often by a large margin. Despite the vast amount of human ingenuity put into crafting domain-specific knowledge and features for AI systems, computation often outperforms these human-crafted systems. It\'s essential to note that, while the Bitter Lesson suggests that leveraging computation is key to advancing AI, it does not completely negate the value of human knowledge. Rather, it underscores the need to find ways to effectively combine human knowledge with computational power to achieve better performance in AI systems.\n\n**Historical evidence**. The Bitter Lesson has been evidenced by the success of AI in various domains like games, vision, and language modeling. For instance, Deep Blue\'s victory over chess world champion Garry Kasparov was achieved not through a detailed understanding of human chess strategies, but through leveraging a massive deep search of possible moves. Similarly, AlphaGo, which defeated Go world champion Lee Sedol, used deep learning and Monte Carlo tree search to find its moves, rather than relying on human-crafted Go strategies. Following this, AlphaZero, using self-play without any human-generated Go data, managed to beat AlphaGo. In each of these cases, the AI systems leveraged computation over human knowledge, demonstrating the Bitter Lesson in action. In 1970, the DARPA SUR (Speech Understanding Research) was held. One faction endeavored to leverage expert knowledge of words, phonemes, the human vocal tract, etc. In contrast, the other side employed newer, more statistical methods that necessitated considerably more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). This example shows yet again, that the statistical methods surpassed the human-knowledge-based methods. Since then, deep learning recurrent neural network-based or transformer-based methods have virtually dominated the field of sequence-based tasks. ([source](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html))\n\nThis subsection talked about why we started aggressively scaling out models. Due to repeated reminders of the bitter lesson, the field of AI has increasingly learned to favor general-purpose methods of search and learning. The next sections show empirical evidence for this claim delving into trends of scale in compute, dataset size, and parameter count.\n\n## Scaling Variables\n\nThis section explains the primary variables involved in scaling - compute, data, and parameters.\n\n**Compute**. Compute refers to the total processing power and resources utilized for machine learning tasks measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s). FLOP/s refers to a measure of computer performance and is used to quantify the number of arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that a processor can perform per second. It dictates the speed and capacity of training runs. As the amount of training data increases, the model requires more information to analyze in each training run, hence increasing the total amount of processing power required. This aspect ties closely with the duration of the training process. For instance, extended training runs generally result in lower loss, and the total computational power needed partially depends on this training duration.\n\n**Dataset size**. Dataset size refers to the amount of data used for training the machine learning model. The larger the dataset, the more information the model can read. Simultaneously, to read and learn from more data, the training runs also need to be generally longer, which in turn increases the total computational power needed before the model can be deemed "trained." The relation between model size and dataset size is typically one-to-one, meaning that as we scale up the model, we also need to scale up the dataset. The quality of the data is also crucial, and not just the quantity.\n\n**Parameter Count**. Parameter count represents the number of tunable variables or weights in a machine learning model. The size of the model, meaning the number of parameters, affects the compute required: the more parameters a model has, the more compute-heavy the process of calculating loss and updating weights becomes. A larger parameter count allows the model to learn more complex representations but also increases the risk of overfitting, where the model becomes too tailored to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.\n\nThe following example offers a tangible illustration of capabilities increasing with an increasing parameter count in image generation models. In the following images, the same model architecture Parti is used to generate an image using an identical prompt, with the sole difference between the models being the parameter size.\n\n![Enter image alt description](Images/Dhh_Image_17.png)\n\n***Figure****: Images generated with the prompt, “a portrait photo of a kangaroo wearing an orange hoodie and blue sunglasses standing on the grass in front of the Sydney Opera House holding a sign on the chest that says Welcome Friends!”. Source: GoogleAI (2022) , "**[Parti (Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image model)](https://parti.research.google/)**"*\n\nIncreased numbers of parameters not only enhance image quality but also aid the network in generalizing in various ways. More parameters enable the model to generate accurate representations of complex elements, such as hands and text, which are notoriously challenging. There are noticeable leaps in quality, and somewhere between 3 billion and 20 billion parameters, the model acquires the ability to spell words correctly. Parti is the first model with the ability to spell correctly. Before Parti, it was uncertain if such an ability could be obtained merely through scaling, but it is now evident that spelling correctly is another capability gained simply by leveraging scale. ([source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uKp6tBFStnsvrot5t/what-dall-e-2-can-and-cannot-do))\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the impact of each of these three factors on model loss.\n\n![Enter image alt description](Images/nQO_Image_18.png)\n\n***Figure****: Kaplan, Jared et. al. (Jan 2020) “**[Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)**”*\n\nThe current trends in various important variables to AI scaling are as below. Trends and bottlenecks for each of these are discussed in more detail in the appendix.\n\n- **Compute** : The compute used to train AI models grew 4-5x yearly from 2010 to May 2024. Generally compute used to train has been growing at 4.1x per year since 2010 with a 90% confidence interval: 3.7x to 4.6x. ([source](https://epochai.org/trends))\n\n- **Hardware** : The computational performance (FLOP/s) is growing by 1.35x per year. With a 90% confidence interval: 1.31x to 1.40x. ([source](https://epochai.org/trends))\n\n- **Data** : Training dataset sizes for language models have grown by 3x per year since 2010. Given these trends, the median projected year in which most of the effective stock of publicly available human-generated text will be used in a training run is 2028, with a 90% confidence interval that we will use up all the text data between 2026 to 2033. ([source](https://epochai.org/trends))\n\n- **Algorithms** : Due to algorithmic efficiency the physical compute required to achieve a given performance in language models is declining at a rate of 3 times per year. With a 95% confidence interval this is a rate of decline between 2 times to 6 times. It is also worth noting that the improvements to compute efficiency explain roughly 35% of performance improvements in language modeling since 2014, vs 65% explained by increases in model scale. ([source](https://epochai.org/trends))\n\n- **Costs** : The cost in USD of training frontier ML models has grown by 2.4x per year since 2016, with a 90% confidence interval this is between 2x to 3.1x. This suggests that the largest frontier models will cost over a billion dollars by 2027. Today, the total amortized cost of developing Gemini Ultra, including hardware, electricity, and staff compensation, is estimated at $130 million USD, with a 90% confidence interval it is between $70 million to $290 million. ([source](https://epochai.org/trends))\n\n\n## 1.4.3 Scaling Laws\n\n<iframe style=" width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncCuJWJm8M8"></iframe>\n\n**Why do we care about scaling laws?** Scaling laws are mathematical relationships that describe how the performance of a machine learning model changes as we vary different aspects of the model and its training process. Training large foundation models like GPT is expensive. When potentially millions of dollars are invested in training AI models, developers need to ensure that funds are efficiently allocated. Developers need to decide on an appropriate resource allocation between - model size, training time, and dataset size. Scaling laws can guide decisions between trade-offs, such as: Should a developer invest in a license to train on Stack Overflow\'s data, or should they invest in more GPUs? Would it be efficient if they continued to cover the extra costs incurred by longer model training? If access to compute increases tenfold, how many parameters should be added to the model for optimal use of GPUs? For sizable language models like GPT-3, these trade-offs might resemble choosing between training a 20-billion parameter model on 40% of an internet archive or a 200-billion parameter model on just 4% of the same archive. ([source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/midXmMb2Xg37F2Kgn/new-scaling-laws-for-large-language-models)) In short, scaling laws are important because they help us optimally allocate resources, and they allow us to make predictions about how changes in compute, model size, and data size will affect the performance of future models.\n\n**What are the scaling equations?** The mathematical representation of scaling laws often takes the form of power-law relationships. For instance, one of the key findings of OpenAI\'s research was that model performance (measured as loss) scales as a power law with respect to model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute. The exact equations can vary depending on the specific scaling law, but a general form could be:\n\n$$\\text{Performance} = k \\cdot (\\text{Compute})^a \\cdot (\\text{Model size})^b \\cdot (\\text{Data size})^c$$\n\nWhere $k$ is a constant, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the exponents that describe how performance scales with compute, model size, and data size, respectively.\n\n### "**2020 OpenAI’s scaling laws**"\n\nOpenAI developed the first generation of formal neural scaling laws in their 2020 paper “[Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)”, moving away from reliance on experience and intuition. To determine the relationships between different scaling variables, some elements were held fixed while others were varied. As an example, data can be kept constant, while parameter count and training time are varied, or parameter count is kept constant and data amounts are varied, etc… This allows a measurement of the relative contribution of each towards overall performance. Such experiments allowed the development of concrete relationships that OpenAI first introduced as scaling laws.\n\nThe paper presented several scaling laws. One scaling law compares model shape and model size and found that performance correlates strongly with scale and weakly with architectural hyperparameters of model shape, such as depth vs. width. Another law compared the relative performance contribution of the different factors of scale - data, training steps, and parameter count. They found that larger language models tend to be more sample-efficient, meaning they can achieve better performance with less data. The following graph shows the relationship between the relative contributions of different factors in scaling models. The graph indicates that for optimally compute-efficient training “*most of the increase should go towards increased model size. A relatively small increase in data is needed to avoid reuse. Of the increase in data, most can be used to increase parallelism through larger batch sizes, with only a very small increase in serial training time required.*” ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)) As an example, according to OpenAI\'s results, if you get 10x more compute, you increase your model size by about 5x and your data size by about 2x. Another 10x in compute, and model size is 25x bigger, and the data size is only 4x bigger. ([source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/midXmMb2Xg37F2Kgn/new-scaling-laws-for-large-language-models))\n\n![Enter image alt description](Images/o2j_Image_19.png)\n\n***Figure:**** Kaplan, Jared et. al. (Jan 2020) “**[Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)**”*\n\n### "**2022 DeepMinds scaling laws (Chinchilla scaling laws)**"\n\n\nIn 2022, DeepMind provided an update to OpenAIs scaling laws by publishing a paper called “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models” ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556)). They choose 9 different quantities of compute, ranging from about 10^18 FLOPs to 10^21 FLOPs. They hold the compute fixed at these amounts, and then for each quantity of compute, they train many different-sized models. Because the quantity of compute is constant for each level, the smaller models are trained for more time and the larger models for less. Based on their research DeepMind concluded that for every increase in compute, you should increase data size and model size by approximately the same amount. If you get a 100x increase in compute, you should make your model 10x bigger and your data 10x bigger. ([source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/midXmMb2Xg37F2Kgn/new-scaling-laws-for-large-language-models))\n\nTo validate this law, DeepMind trained a 70-billion parameter model ("Chinchilla") using the same compute as had been used for the 280-billion parameter model Gopher. That is, the smaller Chinchilla was trained with 1.4 trillion tokens, whereas the larger Gopher was only trained with 300 billion tokens. As predicted by the new scaling laws, Chinchilla surpasses Gopher in almost every metric. When training runs use these scaling laws, they are sometimes referred to as chinchilla optimal.\n\n\n### "**2023 Broken Neural scaling laws**"\n\n[[2210.14891] Broken Neural Scaling Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14891)\n\n## 1.4.4 Scaling Hypotheses {: #04 }\n\nWe have explored and understood foundation models, as well as observed the increasing capabilities obtained through sheer scale. There are some researchers who believe that scale is overemphasized, while others think that scale alone is enough to lead us to AGI. Researchers are divided: some argue for new paradigms or algorithms, while others believe in scaling current models to achieve AGI. In this subsection, we explore two scaling hypotheses: from considering computation as a crucial but not exclusive factor to viewing it as the primary bottleneck.\n\n**Weak Scaling Hypothesis**. The weak scaling hypothesis suggests that computation is a main bottleneck to AGI, but other factors, like architecture, might also be vital. It was originally coined by Gwern, and states that \n\n!!! quote "Gwern (2022) “[The Scaling Hypothesis](https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis#scaling-hypothesis)”."\n\n“*… **AGI will require us to “find the right algorithms” effectively replicating a mammalian brain module by module, and that while these modules will be extremely large & expensive by contemporary standards (which is why compute is important, to give us “a more powerful tool with which to hunt for the right algorithms”), they still need to be invented & finetuned piece by piece, with little risk or surprise until the final assembly.*“\n\nLeCun\'s H-Jepa architecture ([source](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf)), or Richard Sutton’s Alberta Plan ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11173)) are notable plans that might support the weak scaling hypothesis. Proponents of this hypothesis generally have a number of criticisms regarding current LLMs, which are discussed in the Appendix.\n\n**Strong Scaling Hypothesis**. In the same post, Gwern also posited the strong scaling hypothesis, which states that:\n\n!!! quote "Gwern (2022) “[The Scaling Hypothesis](https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis#scaling-hypothesis)”."\n\n\n“*... once we find a scalable architecture like self-attention or convolutions, which like the brain can be applied fairly uniformly, we can simply train ever larger NNs and ever more sophisticated behavior will emerge naturally as the easiest way to optimize for all the tasks & data. More powerful NNs are ‘just’ scaled-up weak NNs, in much the same way that human brains look much like scaled-up primate brains.*”\n\nThis hypothesis advocates that merely scaling up models on more data, modalities, and computation will resolve most current AI limitations. This strong scaling hypothesis is strongly coupled with the phenomenon that is called “The blessing of scale”, which is a general phenomenon in the literature: “*The blessings of scale are the observation that for deep learning, hard problems are easier to solve than easy problems—everything gets better as it gets larger (in contrast to the usual outcome in research, where small things are hard and large things impossible). The bigger the neural net/compute/data/problem, the faster it learns, the better it learns, the stabler it learns, and so on. A problem we can’t solve at all at small n may suddenly become straightforward with millions or billions of n. “NNs are lazy”: they can do far more than we make them do when we push them beyond easy answers & cheap shortcuts. The bitter lesson is the harder and bigger, the better.*” See a discussion in “[The Scaling Hypothesis](https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis#blessings-of-scale)” for other, many examples in the literature.\n\nProponents include OpenAI ([sou](https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond)[rce](https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond))[^3] , Anthropic’s head Dario Amodei ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlkk3glap_U)), DeepMind’s safety team ([source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GctJD5oCDRxCspEaZ/clarifying-ai-x-risk#Development_model__))[^4], Conjecture ([source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PE22QJSww8mpwh7bt/agi-in-sight-our-look-at-the-game-board)) and others.\n\n[^3]:The Superintelligence team at OpenAI announces their goal of creating AI capable of autonomous alignment research within 4 years (by 2027).

This entails reading Chapters 1 through 5. These chapters explain in an accessible way why it is plausible to see the emergence of human-level AI, the potential risks associated, and what solutions are currently being explored to mitigate these risks. These introductory chapters aim to provide a solid foundation for understanding the issues and challenges of AI Safety.\n</p>\n\n### Chapter 1: Capabilities\n\nFirst in the series on fundamentals is a chapter on capabilities. Capabilities are specific, measurable abilities of artificial intelligence systems across various domains. These can be abilities on specific quantifiable tasks (e.g., performance on standardized benchmarks) or more complex, fuzzy abilities (e.g., persuasion or situational awareness).\n\nOur first chapter examines the evolution of AI capabilities over recent decades, focusing on why today\'s leading AI models can perform such remarkable tasks. This chapter also clarifies essential terminology used throughout the book. We introduce concepts like the Bitter Lesson and the AI production function, which explain the factors driving AI performance improvements. We also explore potential bottlenecks in AI development, including limitations in data availability, algorithmic advancements, model size, and computational resources.\n\nWe explore various potential paths to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This includes approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents.\n\nThe core objective of this chapter is to examine trends, key capability thresholds, and potential development trajectories, to lay a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters of this textbook. Only when we have a solid understanding based on trends, can we begin to discuss the risks, and then potential solutions in the following chapters.\n\n[:fontawesome-solid-book: Read](01/README.md){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-download: Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10fO4qjxHX3OiNnafNlp5nvF-9nLW8TOt/view?usp=sharing){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-headphones: Listen](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-video: Watch](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-users: Facilitate](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled }\n\n### Chapter 2: Risks Landscape\n\nThe second chapter in the fundamentals series explores the landscape of AI safety risks. Building upon the potential paths to AGI outlined in the first chapter, we map out how these paths lead to corresponding paths to risk.\n\nWe decompose these risks into three main groups: Misuse, Misalignment, and Systemic risks. We explain misuse risks such as bioterrorism, cyberterrorism, and warfare. We introduce the concept of (mis)alignment, discussing why it\'s a particularly challenging problem, with brief overviews of issues like specification gaming and goal misgeneralization. We also discuss systemic risks, including those arising from accidents, persuasion, power concentration, and epistemic erosion. Additionally, we explore factors that may exacerbate all these risks, such as indifference, race dynamics, unpredictability, and large-scale deployment.\n\nThe goal of this chapter is to provide a concrete, comprehensive overview of AI-related risks and their underlying factors. This foundation is crucial for understanding the governance and technical solutions discussed in later chapters, as each of these solutions aims to address one or more of the risks introduced here.\n\n[:fontawesome-solid-book: Read](02/README.md){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-download: Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ymYnH9MfKFw6NnufsTY5BDCAmfVhIJG6/view?usp=sharing){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-headphones: Listen](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-video: Watch](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-users: Facilitate](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled }\n\n### Chapter 3: Solutions Landscape\n\nThe third chapter in the foundations series examines paths to various solutions for the risks identified in the previous chapters. Building on the first chapter\'s exploration of paths to AGI and the second chapter\'s examination of paths to risk from AGI, we now delve into strategies for mitigating these risks.\n\nWe explore risk mitigation strategies corresponding to the categories identified in the previous chapter. For misuse risks, we discuss approaches such as monitored APIs, defense acceleration, and addressing risks from current AI systems.\n\nWe explore solutions to AGI and ASI alignment separately. These cover exploring naive strategies, while also delving into sophisticated approaches like AI control, transparent thoughts, automating alignment research, and designing inherently safe systems.\n\nTo understand proposed solutions to broader systemic risks, we explore AI governance frameworks, organizational safety measures, and the cultivation of a robust safety culture within the AI development community.\n\nOverall, this chapter serves as a stepping stone to future chapters, which will cover each solution mentioned here in greater individual depth. It provides a crucial link between understanding risks and implementing practical safety measures.\n\n[:fontawesome-solid-book: Read](03/README.md){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-download: Download](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-headphones: Listen](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-video: Watch](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-users: Facilitate](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled }\n\n### Chapter 4: Evaluations\n\nThis chapter is currently still being written.\n\nIt will explore the critical role of evaluations in AI safety, presenting a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation types and methods.

The conversation around AI governance gives every reader actionable steps regardless of technical background, allowing more voices to participate in ongoing debates to the development of safe AI.\n\nWe will explain the full landscape of AI governance across corporate, national, and international levels. The chapter will cover:\n\n- Unique challenges posed by AI development and deployment, including rapid capability emergence and proliferation risks.\n- Key governance functions and levers, with a focus on the role of compute as a critical resource.\n- Critical issues complicating AI governance efforts, such as competition dynamics, uncertainty in predicting AI impacts, accountability challenges, and distributive consequences.\n- Analysis of specific governance initiatives and policy options at corporate, national, and international levels.\n- Exploration of adaptive governance approaches and novel mechanisms like algorithmic governance.\n- Lessons from governance efforts in other fields and their potential application to AI.\n\n[:fontawesome-solid-book: Read](05/README.md){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-download: Download](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-headphones: Listen](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-video: Watch](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-users: Facilitate](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled }\n\n## TECHNICAL SAFETY\n\nIn this part, we dive into the specific technical challenges of AI alignment. We explore key concepts and methodologies crucial for ensuring the safe development and deployment of advanced AI systems. These chapters build upon the foundational knowledge established in the earlier sections, providing a deeper understanding of the technical intricacies involved in AI safety.\n\nThese chapters assume some basic familiarity with Machine Learning (ML). Please take your time to understand the core concepts, *especially* transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).\n\nIn structuring the chapters we tried to follow the paradigm of - present the problem in detail, and then present the solutions to the problem in detail. So each chapter begins with an exploration of what exactly the problem is, why this a problem, and then how exactly are researchers trying to solve this problem as well as potential limitations of the proposed solutions.\n\n### Chapter 6: Reward Misspecification\n\nThe first chapter in the technical safety series addresses a fundamental challenge in AI alignment: the problem of reward misspecification. We explore how reward functions given to reinforcement learning agents can fail to capture intended goals, leading to unintended behaviors. The chapter covers key concepts such as reinforcement learning fundamentals, optimization pitfalls including Goodhart\'s Law, and various reward-related challenges. We then examine alternative approaches like imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning. Finally, we discuss advanced techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its extensions, including their limitations and potential solutions like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\n\n[:fontawesome-solid-book: Read](06/README.md){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-download: Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1my3TSNPU-gzzv48MEN763EhIYL_UvG5v/view?usp=sharing){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-headphones: Listen](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-video: Watch](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-users: Facilitate](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled }\n\n### Chapter 7: Goal Misgeneralization\n\nThe second chapter in the technical safety series, addresses Goal Misgeneralization. This is the problem of AI systems pursuing targets that differ from those intended by the developers. We explore why exactly cross distribution generalization is a difficult problem and covers concepts such as mesa-optimization, inner alignment, and deceptive alignment.\n\n[:fontawesome-solid-book: Read](07/README.md){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-download: Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lHSTzwlDukble7n1dXO5zoKhAybXgRYo/view?usp=sharing){ .md-button } \n[:fontawesome-solid-headphones: Listen](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-video: Watch](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled } \n[:fontawesome-solid-users: Facilitate](){ .md-button .md-button--disabled }\n\n### Chapter 8: Scalable Oversight\n\nThis chapter follows up from the chapter on specification gaming.

Evaluation means checking how well the AI did after completing a task, while feedback is the information we give to the AI during or after it works to help it learn and improve. Right now, we can still use methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to guide AI in the right direction. But we can only give feedback if we can still evaluate the outputs. As tasks get more complex, even experts might struggle to provide accurate evaluations and feedback. So, we need new ways to give accurate feedback, even for tasks that are beyond human expertise. This is the goal of scalable oversight.\n\nScalable Oversight techniques help humans provide accurate feedback on tasks to ensure AI systems are aligned with our goals, even after the task complexity outstrips the ability of the best human experts. This can happen during the AI's training or deployment and isn't limited to RLHF-style feedback.\n\n**Aligning RL Agents vs. LLMs**. A few years ago it looked like the path to AGI was by training deep RL agents from scratch in a wide range of games and multi-agent environments. These agents would be aligned to maximizing simple score functions such as survival and winning games and wouldn’t know much about human values. Aligning the resulting agents would require a lot of effort: not only do we have to create a human-aligned objective function from scratch, we’d likely also need to instill new capabilities into the agents like understanding human society, what humans care about, and how humans think. Large language models (LLMs) make this a lot easier: they come preloaded with a lot of humanity’s knowledge, including detailed knowledge about human preferences and values. Out of the box they aren’t agents who are trying to pursue their own goals in the world, and their objective functions are quite malleable. For example, they are surprisingly easy to train to behave more nicely. If AGI comes out of LLMs it might be easier to align. ([Jan Leike,, 2022](https://aligned.substack.com/p/alignment-optimism))\n\n## 8.1.1 Training Signals & Fuzzy Tasks {: #01 }\n\nBefore we understand how to actually align smarter than human AIs, we need to understand the general concept of training signals and why they are getting increasingly harder to generate as AI is starting to display higher levels of general purpose capabilities.\n\n**What are training signals?** Training signals is a general term that we use for inputs that are used to guide AI learning. They can be rewards, labels, or evaluations indicating how well the AI is performing a task. For example:\n\n- In supervised learning (SL), the training signal is the correct label for each example.\n\n- For large language models (LLMs) using self-supervised learning (SSL), training signals are the correct next word in a sentence during pre-training. Human feedback on the quality of responses during fine-tuning is also a type of training signal guiding the outputs in a direction we want (a more “aligned” direction).\n\n- In reinforcement learning (RL), training signals are rewards based on the success or failure of actions, like points scored in a game or successful navigation to a location.\n\nThese signals shape how AI systems learn and are used to both evaluate performance and provide feedback.\n\n**Easy-to-generate training signals.** For some tasks, generating training signals is simple. AlphaGo Zero, an RL agent playing Go, is a good example of this. The game has clear rules and win/loss outcomes, so training signals are straightforward: algorithmically generated win and lose signals directly measure performance, making it easy for the model to learn and improve its gameplay.\n\n**Hard-to-generate training signals.** For other tasks, creating training signals is much harder. For example, training GPT models to generate accurate text summaries is challenging. The AI needs to convey correct information while being coherent and interesting. Success is subjective. Since it depends on individual reader preferences, it is hard to define clear, algorithmically generated training signals. Another example is self-driving cars navigating through busy city streets. These cars need to make real-time decisions, and the training signals or rewards for safe and efficient navigation are difficult to define due to varying contexts and sometimes conflicting traffic laws and safety considerations.\n\n**Fuzzy tasks.** We call tasks where training signals are hard to generate fuzzy tasks. These tasks generally have ambiguous or ill-defined objectives and outcomes. We can’t generate precise training signals due to inherent subjectivity and variability in “correct responses”. Fuzzy tasks lack clear, objective criteria for success. Unlike well-defined tasks with specific, measurable goals, fuzzy tasks are more open-ended, which complicates our job of coming up with training signals. If it's difficult to provide precise rewards or labels that accurately capture the desired behavior, the training process becomes complicated. AI systems might not receive the consistent, reliable feedback needed to learn effectively. This is essentially highlighting again the difficulty of the reward specification problem that we talked about in previous chapters.\n\n**Fuzzy tasks and Scalable Oversight.** Fuzzy tasks are closely related to AI alignment, where ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human values and intentions is challenging due to ambiguity and subjectivity. Aligning AI with human values is a fuzzy task. Oversight techniques aim to solve alignment by providing training signals for fuzzy tasks, including feedback and imitation learning techniques like RLHF, Constitutional AI (CAI), and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). Scalable oversight techniques aim to provide training signals for fuzzy tasks that are too complex for even experts to understand or evaluate.\n\nTo make scalable oversight techniques viable, tasks need to have two key properties: verification needs to be easier than generation, and tasks need to be decomposable. These properties will be discussed in the next sections.\n\n## 8.1.2 Verification vs. Generation {: #02 }\n\n**What Does P ≠ NP Mean?** In computer science, we classify problems based on how hard they are to solve (generate a solution) and how hard they are to check (verify a solution).\n\n- P (Polynomial time): These are problems that a computer can solve quickly.\n\n- NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time): These are problems where, if you have a solution, you can check it quickly, but finding the solution might take a long time.\n\n**What is generation?** Generation is the process of coming up with solutions from scratch. This means searching through many possibilities, which can take a lot of time and computing power. For example, solving a Sudoku puzzle involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating. If you've ever tried to solve a Sudoku puzzle, you know it involves a lot of trial and error to make sure all the rules are followed.\n\n![Enter image alt description](Images/nDa_Image_1.png)\n\n**Figure**: ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku))\n\nGeneration here involves filling in the blank grid while ensuring all the constraints (unique numbers in rows, columns, and subgrids) are satisfied.\n\n**What is verification?** Verification is the process of checking whether a given solution attempt is correct. Using the Sudoku example, verification means making sure that each row, column, and subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without any repeats. Once someone gives you a completed Sudoku puzzle, checking whether it's correct is straightforward and quick. This idea is central to the concept of \\( P \\neq NP \\).\n\n![Enter image alt description](Images/NXb_Image_2.png)\n\n**Figure**: ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku))\n\n**Examples: Illustrating Verification is Easier Than Generation**. Evaluation is easier than generation is a very general property that holds across many domains:\n\n- Formal Problems: In computational complexity theory, most computer scientists believe that \\( P \\neq NP \\) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Reasons_to_believe_P_%E2%89%A0_NP_or_P_=_NP)), which means there are many problems where checking a solution is easier than finding one. This is seen in tasks like solving SAT problems or graph algorithms.\n\n- Sports and Games: It's easier to look at a football scoreboard to see who is winning than it is to play the game well.\n\n- Consumer Products: Comparing the quality of smartphones based on user reviews is simpler than designing and building a new smartphone.\n\n- Job Performance: Evaluating how well an employee is doing is less demanding than actually doing the job.\n\n- Academic Research: While reviewing research can be tough, it's still less work than producing  new research.\n\n**Why Verification Being Easier Than Generation Matters for Scalable Oversight**. This fact is crucial for scalable oversight because it allows us as human overseers to efficiently ensure the correctness and safety of outputs produced by complex systems without needing to fully understand or replicate the entire generation process. If \\( P \\neq NP \\) is true , it implies that we might be able to trust and delegate alignment research itself to AI models, because we can comparatively easily verify that their solutions work while they have to do the hard task of generating the solutions to alignment. Overall operating under this assumption can make the task of aligning advanced AI systems seem more feasible. The next few paragraphs go into the debate of how valid this assumption is.\n\n**Verification in Adversarial Contexts**. When verifying something in situations where someone might be actively trying to trick or attack you, the process becomes much harder. Put another way, if we have AIs that are deceptive, the problem becomes significantly trickier. For example, making sure software is secure against all possible attacks can be tougher than writing the software in the first place. An attacker only needs to find one security hole, but the person verifying must check everything to ensure there are no holes. This makes verification very challenging. Similarly creating a secure system in cryptography is hard, but proving that it’s secure against all possible attacks is even more difficult. You need to consider every potential way someone might try to break the system, which is a huge task.\n\n**Easier than generation does not mean verification is trivial**. Just because verification is theoretically easier than generation doesn’t mean it’s always easy in practice. For example, checking a complex mathematical proof can be very hard. Writing the proof takes creativity and deep understanding, but verifying it requires careful and detailed checking, which can be exhausting and prone to mistakes. In the case of software, writing secure software is challenging, but verifying that it’s completely secure is even harder. Even though verifying a problem’s solution might be easier than generating the solution, the process can still be very difficult and require significant effort and expertise.\n\n**Verification of Safety vs. Provable Alignment**. In the event that we have to deal with superintelligent AI, just verifying its behavior might not be enough. Some researchers argue that we need to prove that the AI will always act in ways that align with human values. Verification means checking whether the AI behaves correctly in specific situations. Provable alignment means giving solid evidence that the AI will act correctly in every possible situation, even new and unexpected ones. This requires more than just checking—it needs formal methods and guarantees, which is extremely difficult.\n\n**Verification vs. Mathematical Proof**. Verification involves checking if a specific solution is correct, usually through testing or inspection. A mathematical proof, on the other hand, is a rigorous logical argument that shows a statement is always true. For example, verifying a Sudoku solution checks if the given arrangement is correct, while a mathematical proof might show that any Sudoku puzzle with a certain number of clues always has a unique solution.\n"}},1798:function(e){e.exports={attributes:{title:"My First Blog Post",date:"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z",excerpt:"This is a short excerpt of my first blog post."},body:"# My First Blog Post\n\nThis is the content of my first blog post.\n\nHere's an image:\n\n![Sample Image](./images/sample.jpg)\n\nAnd here's a LaTeX equation:\n\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$"}},94:function(e,a,s){"use strict";var i=s(5130),t=s(6768),o=s(4232);function n(e,a,s,i,n,r){const l=(0,t.g2)("TopBar"),g=(0,t.g2)("Sidebar"),m=(0,t.g2)("MainContent");return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",{id:"app",class:(0,o.C4)({"dark-mode":i.isDarkMode})},[(0,t.bF)(l),(0,t.bF)(g),(0,t.bF)(m)],2)}var r=s(782);const l={class:"top-bar"},g={class:"page-title"};function m(e,a,s,i,n,r){return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",l,[(0,t.Lk)("button",{class:"hamburger-menu",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...e)=>i.toggleSidebar&&i.toggleSidebar(...e))}," ☰ "),(0,t.Lk)("h1",g,(0,o.v_)(i.currentPageTitle),1)])}var h=s(1387),d={name:"TopBar",setup(){const e=(0,r.Pj)(),a=(0,h.lq)(),s=()=>{e.dispatch("content/toggleSidebar")},i=(0,t.EW)((()=>a.meta.title||""));return{toggleSidebar:s,currentPageTitle:i}}},p=s(1241);const u=(0,p.A)(d,[["render",m],["__scopeId","data-v-5b06fe8e"]]);var c=u;const b={class:"sidebar"};function f(e,a,s,i,n,r){const l=(0,t.g2)("font-awesome-icon"),g=(0,t.g2)("router-link");return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",{class:(0,o.C4)(["sidebar-container",{"sidebar-open":i.isOpen}])},[(0,t.Lk)("div",b,[(0,t.Lk)("nav",null,[(0,t.Lk)("ul",null,[((0,t.uX)(!0),(0,t.CE)(t.FK,null,(0,t.pI)(i.menuItems,(e=>((0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("li",{key:e.path},[(0,t.bF)(g,{to:e.path,"exact-active-class":"active",onClick:i.handleItemClick},{default:(0,t.k6)((()=>[(0,t.bF)(l,{icon:e.icon,class:"nav-icon"},null,8,["icon"]),(0,t.eW)(" "+(0,o.v_)(e.name),1)])),_:2},1032,["to","onClick"])])))),128))])])])],2)}var y={name:"SidebarMenu",setup(){const e=(0,r.Pj)(),a=(0,t.EW)((()=>e.state.content.sidebarOpen)),s=()=>{e.dispatch("theme/toggleTheme")},i=()=>{window.innerWidth<=768&&e.dispatch("content/setSidebarOpen",!1)},o=[{name:"About",path:"/about",icon:"user-circle"},{name:"Books",path:"/books",icon:"book"},{name:"Writing",path:"/blog",icon:"pen"},{name:"Physical",path:"/activities",icon:"dumbbell"},{name:"Contact",path:"/contact",icon:"envelope"}];return{isOpen:a,toggleTheme:s,handleItemClick:i,menuItems:o}}};const k=(0,p.A)(y,[["render",f],["__scopeId","data-v-03e33a37"]]);var P=k;function v(e,a,s,i,n,r){const l=(0,t.g2)("router-view");return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("main",{class:(0,o.C4)(["main-content",{"sidebar-open":i.isSidebarOpen}])},[(0,t.bF)(l)],2)}var w={name:"MainContent",setup(){const e=(0,r.Pj)(),a=(0,t.EW)((()=>e.state.content.sidebarOpen));return{isSidebarOpen:a}}};const S=(0,p.A)(w,[["render",v],["__scopeId","data-v-2d9b4754"]]);var T=S,L={name:"App",components:{TopBar:c,Sidebar:P,MainContent:T},setup(){const e=(0,r.Pj)(),a=(0,t.EW)((()=>e.state.theme.isDarkMode));return{isDarkMode:a}}};const H=(0,p.A)(L,[["render",n]]);var R=H;const A={class:"about content-container"},N={class:"tabs-container"},C=["onClick"];function I(e,a,s,i,n,r){const l=(0,t.g2)("AboutTab");return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",A,[(0,t.Lk)("div",N,[((0,t.uX)(!0),(0,t.CE)(t.FK,null,(0,t.pI)(i.tabs,(e=>((0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("button",{key:e.key,onClick:a=>i.currentTab=e.key,class:(0,o.C4)(["tab-button",{active:i.currentTab===e.key}])},(0,o.v_)(e.label),11,C)))),128))]),(0,t.bF)(l,{tab:i.currentTab,overview:i.overview,favorites:i.favorites},null,8,["tab","overview","favorites"])])}var z=s(144);const j={class:"about-tab"},B={key:0,class:"overview"},M={key:1,class:"favorites"},E={class:"favorite-grid"},W={class:"favorite-image"},D=["src","alt","onError"],F={class:"favorite-image-placeholder"},x={class:"favorite-name"};function _(e,a,s,n,r,l){const g=(0,t.g2)("font-awesome-icon");return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)(t.FK,null,[(0,t.eW)(" this page is generic for now, these things here dont actually represent what i like, its all biolerplate going to be replaced.
