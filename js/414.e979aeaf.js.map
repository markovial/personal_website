It aims to provide secure, private, and untraceable transactions. Here's a detailed explanation of various aspects of Monero:\\n\\n\\nMonero is based on the CryptoNote protocol, which uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to obscure transaction details. It employs a proof-of-work consensus mechanism called RandomX, which is ASIC-resistant and designed to be more egalitarian for CPU miners.\\nPrivacy Features:\\na) Ring Signatures: These allow a sender to hide their transaction among a group of others, making it unclear which funds were actually spent.\\nb) Stealth Addresses: One-time addresses are generated for each transaction, preventing public association of multiple transactions with a single wallet.\\nc) RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions): This feature hides the amount of XMR being transferred.\\nd) Kovri: An in-development feature to route transactions through I2P nodes, hiding a user's IP address.\\nFungibility:\\nUnlike Bitcoin, where coins can be traced and potentially \\\"tainted\\\" by their history, all Monero coins are functionally identical and interchangeable. This makes Monero truly fungible.\\nMining:\\nMonero uses the RandomX algorithm, which is designed to be ASIC-resistant and favors CPU mining. This aims to keep mining decentralized and accessible to individual users.\\nDynamic Block Size:\\nMonero can automatically adjust its block size based on transaction volume, helping to prevent network congestion.\\nRegular Protocol Upgrades:\\nThe Monero community regularly implements hard forks to upgrade the protocol, usually twice a year. These upgrades often include security improvements and new features.\\nEconomic Model:\\nMonero has a slightly inflationary model. After the initial supply is mined, there will be a permanent fixed subsidy of 0.6 XMR per block to incentivize miners.\\n\\n<!-- level: 2 -->\\n\\n## Stealth Addresses\\n\\n## Ring confidential transactions\\n\\n## Ring Signatures\\n\\n## RandomX\\n\\n## Problems\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZjcFRdvbjc\\n\\n## Bisq\\n\\n## Haveno\\n\\n## To be added\\nhttps://www.getmonero.org/get-started/faq/#videos\\nhttps://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrHsFZBab4U\\n\\n\";"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
