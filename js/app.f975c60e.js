They did tell me one or two, but then later I got a link to a full page with currently reading, reading history, and want to read books. I thought this was really awesome!! So, if anything is awesome you copy it. I could see what the person was interested in, had knowledge of, and also how their interests evolved over time. This is basically my attempt at recreating that. I know I could have just pointed to a goodreads page, but I like coding things, and this was the page on the site I was most excited about building anyway. So here we are. Right now you can sort, and change display view styles (I display list by default as a happy medium. I actually prefer compact though. Go ahead play and see which one you might like better). I think one upgrade that I would want to make in the future, is some way to hide all the manwha, and graphic novel style stuff. I read A LOT of those, but I guess more people would be interested in the "serious" like non-fiction type books. So yeah, hiding those is probably a good idea by default.
