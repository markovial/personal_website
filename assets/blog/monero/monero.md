# Monero

Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was launched in 2014. It aims to provide secure, private, and untraceable transactions. Here's a detailed explanation of various aspects of Monero:


Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol, which uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to obscure transaction details. It employs a proof-of-work consensus mechanism called RandomX, which is ASIC-resistant and designed to be more egalitarian for CPU miners.
Privacy Features:
a) Ring Signatures: These allow a sender to hide their transaction among a group of others, making it unclear which funds were actually spent.
b) Stealth Addresses: One-time addresses are generated for each transaction, preventing public association of multiple transactions with a single wallet.
c) RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions): This feature hides the amount of XMR being transferred.
d) Kovri: An in-development feature to route transactions through I2P nodes, hiding a user's IP address.
Fungibility:
Unlike Bitcoin, where coins can be traced and potentially "tainted" by their history, all Monero coins are functionally identical and interchangeable. This makes Monero truly fungible.
Mining:
Monero uses the RandomX algorithm, which is designed to be ASIC-resistant and favors CPU mining. This aims to keep mining decentralized and accessible to individual users.
Dynamic Block Size:
Monero can automatically adjust its block size based on transaction volume, helping to prevent network congestion.
Regular Protocol Upgrades:
The Monero community regularly implements hard forks to upgrade the protocol, usually twice a year. These upgrades often include security improvements and new features.
Economic Model:
Monero has a slightly inflationary model. After the initial supply is mined, there will be a permanent fixed subsidy of 0.6 XMR per block to incentivize miners.
