Before 2017 most of the world used Deep Ultra Violet (DUV) technology to produce microchips. Intel was basically the world leader in this industry. They had designs for chips multiple generations in the future but they only produced one every year that was marginally better than the one before. For like 15 years basically nobody was competition to them, so they got lazy.

They also invested in stuff that would take them beyond DUV. This is extreme ultra violet (EUV). This was developed in collaboration with ASML from the Netherlands in roughly like 2016. Using EUV you can get more nodes (nanometers) on the same chip. Key point is that this was all digital. You didnt have to change the actual fabrication hardware like you used to need to do with DUV. Intel was like "Eh, seems cool, but we're already leading, so we're not gonna change anything for years".


Intel was fat and lazy, but TSMC was desperate and hungry. ASML goes to TSMC. TSMC adopts it, and hits the ball out of the park. Intel is left crying in the corner.

In 2023, Intel finally fucking makes its first EUV. But now ASML has high numerical aperture EUV. This time intel is desperate and hungry, and TSMC is fat and lazy. So intel has been the first to adopt H-NA-EUV based chips.

Everything above ~25nm is a team effort
It takes 10s of thousands of companies to make it work

Sub 10nm is AI, electric vehicles,...

For [[China]] to take over TSMC, then they still wouldn't be able to use the facility, because they need the rest of the 99999 companies to agree that it's OK for them to just take this.

But this also applies to the rest of the world.

The difference with [[Intel]], is that they design and manufacture in house, whereas TSMC is just a fabrication plant.

Most of the industries in the world will be semi-OK after deglobalization, but semiconductors will not.

## Open Questions
- Why do nanometers matter for semiconductors?
- What is the difference between a conductor and a semiconductor?
- Why are semiconductors so hard to produce?
- What are the semiconductors global supply chains like today?
